# Hajir-cypress

Welcome to **Hajir-cypress**, a collection of automation scripts for [Ha-jir App](#) - "A modern attendance system for smart people."

## Overview

This repository contains automated tests for both API and web testing of the Ha-jir application.
The tests ensure the reliability and functionality of the application across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before running the automation scripts, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- Node.js and npm installed
- Clone this repository to your local machine
- import or install all the required dependencies

## Running the Scripts

### API Testing

The API tests are located in the `ApiTesting` directory.

#### Steps to Run API Tests:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `ApiTesting` directory in the cloned repository.
3. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open --config-file stage.config.js
  this is one sample for running one environment there may be many environment created you should handle it accordingly.
  
## Configuration
